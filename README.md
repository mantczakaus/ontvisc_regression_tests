# Regression tests for the [ONTViSc pipeline](https://github.com/eresearchqut/ontvisc)
## TO DO WHAT THE TESTS ARE AND WHY WE NEED THEM

## Prerequisites
You will need:
- Java
- [Nextflow](https://www.nextflow.io/docs/latest/index.html)
- Singularity
- Python with [pytest](https://docs.pytest.org/en/stable/getting-started.html)

# Modify
## conf/nextflow.config
Change `PATH_TO_FOLDER` to, for example, the folder to which you cloned the tests. This should be done for the `cacheDir` directive for `singularity` and `conda`. If you want to use Seqera Platform to monitor the runs, set the `accessToken`, `workspaceId` and change `enabled` to `true`. You can use [Seqera Platform](https://seqera.services.biocommons.org.au) from Australian BioCommons if you are an Australian researcher. Otherwise, you can still use the general version of [Seqera Platform](https://docs.seqera.io/platform/24.2). 

## scripts/run_reg_test_and_verify_with_pytest.sh
Set `revision` (`main` by default) and `resume` (only two options can be used `-resume` or `' '`).
Change `PATH_TO_FOLDER` to the folder to which you cloned the tests (variable `execution_dir`).
By default the tests are set up to be submitted to the PBS scheduler with the following options but the analogical command for Slurm is also provided.

## scripts/regression_scenarios/reg_test.sh
Change `PATH_TO_FOLDER` to the folder to which you cloned the tests (variable `reg_dir`).
Load the necessary modules. By default this is set to the following:
'''
module load java
module load nextflow
module load singularity
'''
This needs to be adjusted according to what is available in your environment. You may need to specify versions, some of the programs may be available without the need to load them, etc.

## scripts/run_regression_scenarios_and_verify_with_pytest.sh
Change in the same way as 'run_reg_test_and_verify_with_pytest.sh'
